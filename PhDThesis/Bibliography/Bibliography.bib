  abstract={The CALICE collaboration is studying the design of high performance electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for future International Linear Collider detectors. For the hadronic calorimeter, one option is a highly granular sampling calorimeter with steel as absorber and scintillator layers as active material. High granularity is obtained by segmenting the scintillator into small tiles individually read out via silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM). A prototype has been built, consisting of thirty-eight sensitive layers, segmented into about eight thousand channels. In 2007 the prototype was exposed to positrons and hadrons using the CERN SPS beam, covering a wide range of beam energies and angles of incidence. The challenge of cell equalization and calibration of such a large number of channels is best validated using electromagnetic processes. The response of the prototype steel-scintillator calorimeter, including linearity and uniformity, to electrons is investigated and described.}

  abstract={We investigate the three dimensional substructure of hadronic showers in the CALICE scintillator-steel hadronic calorimeter. The high granularity of the detector is used to find track segments of minimum ionising particles within hadronic showers, providing sensitivity to the spatial structure and the details of secondary particle production in hadronic cascades. The multiplicity, length and angular distribution of identified track segments are compared to GEANT4 simulations with several different shower models. Track segments also provide the possibility for in-situ calibration of highly granular calorimeters.}

abstract = "Abstract A first prototype of a scintillator strip-based electromagnetic calorimeter was built, consisting of 26 layers of tungsten absorber plates interleaved with planes of 45×10×3 mm3 plastic scintillator strips. Data were collected using a positron test beam at \{DESY\} with momenta between 1 and 6 GeV/c. The prototype׳s performance is presented in terms of the linearity and resolution of the energy measurement. These results represent an important milestone in the development of highly granular calorimeters using scintillator strip technology. A number of possible design improvements were identified, which should be implemented in a future detector of this type. This technology is being developed for a future linear collider experiment, aiming at the precise measurement of jet energies using particle flow techniques. "

The analysis described in this paper focuses on electromagnetic shower reconstruction and characterises the \{ECAL\} response to electrons in terms of energy resolution and linearity. The detector is linear to within approximately the 1% level and has a relative energy resolution of ( 16.53 ± 0.14 ( stat ) ± 0.4 ( syst ) ) / E ( GeV ) ⊕ ( 1.07 ± 0.07 ( stat ) ± 0.1 ( syst ) ) ( % ) .

  abstract={Power-pulsed readout potentially offers a solution to the problem of high power consumption of the electronics for detectors at the future International Linear Collider (ILC) experiments. A 33 × 50 cm 2 Glass Resistive Plate Chamber (GRPC) equipped with a power-pulsed electronics board offering 1 cm 2 lateral segmentation was successfully tested in a 3-Tesla magnet. A significant reduction in power consumption with no deterioration of the detector performance was obtained when the power-pulsing mode was applied. This result shows that highly granular calorimeters for ILC experiments are not only an attractive but also a realistic option.}

abstract = "We present the mechanical design and construction techniques used in building the barrel calorimeter for the ZEUS detector. The latter is currently under construction for use at the HERA electron-proton colliding beam facility. The calorimeter consists of 32 wedge shaped modules with approximate dimensions of 3×0.5×1.7 m3. The modules use alternate layers of depleted uranium and scintillator with one radiation length sampling. The light is collected via wavelength shifter plates placed on the sloping sides of the modules and read out by photomultiplier tubes located at the outer radius. The unit cell dimensions result in a ratio eh = 1 which yields an optimal energy resolution for hadronic jets. The placing of the structural components and the arrangement of the cracks between modules were chosen to maximize the uniformity of the response. Details of the construction and assembly effort needed to realize the total calorimeter are given. We finally describe the procedures used for transporting the completed modules to DESY and to install them on ZEUS."

  abstract={An analog hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) prototype of 5.3 nuclear interaction lengths thickness has been constructed by members of the CALICE Collaboration. The AHCAL prototype consists of a 38-layer sandwich structure of steel plates and highly-segmented scintillator tiles that are read out by wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to SiPMs. The signal is amplified and shaped with a custom-designed ASIC. A calibration/monitoring system based on LED light was developed to monitor the SiPM gain and to measure the full SiPM response curve in order to correct for non-linearity. Ultimately, the physics goals are the study of hadron shower shapes and testing the concept of particle flow. The technical goal consists of measuring the performance and reliability of 7608 SiPMs. The AHCAL was commissioned in test beams at DESY and CERN. The entire prototype was completed in 2007 and recorded hadron showers, electron showers and muons at different energies and incident angles in test beams at CERN and Fermilab.}

  abstract={The energy resolution of a highly granular 1 m 3 analogue scintillator-steel hadronic calorimeter is studied using charged pions with energies from 10 GeV to 80 GeV at the CERN SPS. The energy resolution for single hadrons is determined to be approximately 58%/√ E /GeV. This resolution is improved to approximately 45%/√ E /GeV with software compensation techniques. These techniques take advantage of the event-by-event information about the substructure of hadronic showers which is provided by the imaging capabilities of the calorimeter. The energy reconstruction is improved either with corrections based on the local energy density or by applying a single correction factor to the event energy sum derived from a global measure of the shower energy density. The application of the compensation algorithms to geant 4 simulations yield resolution improvements comparable to those observed for real data.}

abstract = "The proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) is well-suited for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model and for precisely unraveling the structure of the underlying physics. The physics return can be maximized by the use of polarized beams. This report shows the paramount role of polarized beams and summarizes the benefits obtained from polarizing the positron beam, as well as the electron beam. The physics case for this option is illustrated explicitly by analyzing reference reactions in different physics scenarios. The results show that positron polarization, combined with the clean experimental environment provided by the linear collider, allows to improve strongly the potential of searches for new particles and the identification of their dynamics, which opens the road to resolve shortcomings of the Standard Model. The report also presents an overview of possible designs for polarizing both beams at the ILC, as well as for measuring their polarization. "

abstract = "The Particle Flow (PFlow) approach to calorimetry promises to deliver unprecedented jet energy resolution for experiments at future high energy colliders such as the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC). This paper describes the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm which is then used to perform the first systematic study of the potential of high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry. For simulated events in the \{ILD\} detector concept, a jet energy resolution of σ E / E ≲ 3.8 % is achieved for 40–400 GeV jets. This result, which demonstrates that high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry can meet the challenging \{ILC\} jet energy resolution goals, does not depend strongly on the details of the Monte Carlo modelling of hadronic showers. The PandoraPFA algorithm is also used to investigate the general features of a collider detector optimised for high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry. Finally, a first study of the potential of high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry at a multi-TeV lepton collider, such as CLIC, is presented. "

  abstract={The availability of full size MAPS sensors makes it possible to construct a calorimeter with pixelsize of a few tens of micrometers. This would be small enough to count individual shower particles and would allow a shower shape analysis on an unprecedented, small scale. Interesting features would be tracking capability for particle flow algorithms and a superior discrimination of single photons from neutral and charged pions at high momenta. A small Molière radius together with high transverse resolution would allow to separate close showers, induced by photons from neutral pion decay. A full scale (4 R M , 28 X 0 ) prototype was constructed to demonstrate this. It features 30 micron pixelsize and a longitudinal sampling at 1 radiation length. We will show results from beam tests of this prototype at electron energies of 2 to 200 GeV.}

  abstract={In this paper we will show a general method of how to make an optimized parameter design of a circular e + e − Higgs factory by using analytical expression of maximum beam-beam parameter and beamstrahlung beam lifetime starting from a given design goal and technical limitations. A parameter space has been explored. Based on beam parameters scan and RF parameters scan, a set of optimized parameter designs for 50 km Circular Higgs Factory (CHF) with different RF frequency was proposed.}
