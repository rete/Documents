#Correction Oleg Markin 1 :

Dear Remi,

you've written a beautiful note! In particular let me thank you for the detailed description of the ArborPFA, on behalf of those who is going to use it. I wish there were an equally good description of the PandoraPFA when I was working with it.  By the way, to attract attention of a reader to the work's results, I would still place the section about the ArborPFA (#3) behind the section #5 or maybe into appendices -- let us remember the title declares the note is not about the algorithm itself.

Since you have made the text using a JINST template, I comment it like something more than simply an internal note, so please ignore those of my comments that assume a non-CALICE reader while you are at the note stage. Your English is mostly clear and pure, though I am not satisfied with wording in several places, so please consult a native speaker where I am not sure (marked CNS). The comments and suggestions for lines are interleaved with general ones.

The algorithm parameters in the appendices are interesting if they are optimized to provide the best separation of showers. Otherwise, I think their values are not that important for understanding of the written and not needed for the JINST.

[OK] l.18 "Separation of two close-by ..."

[OK] l.29  Should be "in order to distinguish between Z and WÂ± bosons as well as to study Higgs' properties."

[OK] l.30 I would treat the nouns here as uncountable: "To achieve this, both good energy resolution and fine transverse segmentation should be provided ..." -- CNS

[OK and poetic ...] l.37 Why do not use a rhyme : "this calorimeter perfectly fits the ILC needs."

[OK] l.39  "aims to individually reconstruct particles,  using ..." -- CNS

[OK] l.56 why not \cdot

[TO SEE] Please indicate typical numbers of hits at each threshold for a 10 GeV shower -- that is important and interesting.

[OK] l.57 comma before and

[OK] l.58 Maybe "number of hits at thresholds 1, 2 and 3"; comma before where -- CNS

[NOT] Here I am asking myself: do the hits at thresholds 2 and 3 include those at 1 and 2 -- probably not, judging by the formula -- and what are the values of energy, to which the thresholds correspond? I think a couple of sentences explaining details would not hurt.
[-> NOT because of SDHCAL paper reference l.53]

[THANK YOU] Figure 1, left, is an impressive drawing, I like it.

[TO SEE] l.75-78 This information is too poor even for internal reading. For the JINST, it should be either extended or omitted.
[Suggestions ?]

[OK] l.82 "a vertex"

[NOT] l.footnote Why " ... pad could ..", it can, anytime.
[One or more pads could be fired. See sdhcal paper reference about multiplicity]

[OK] l.95 comma before which

[OK] l.103  "a few pads"/"several pads"
[several]

[OK] l.107 Do you mean "each of these hits ..."
[l.108 not 107]

[OK] l.117 Do you intentionally use  a comma within the under-script -- I expect it before "it".
[yes, comma in under-script. Comma after 'it' also added]

[OK] l.footnote "a tracking detector" -- CNS

[OK] l.127 Is the word "face" appropriate here and below, perhaps just remove it -- CNS

[OK] l.133 Do you mean "for example" by "in one case"? Then I would simply stop the sentence after " ... algorithm" -- CNS

[OK] l.155 I would expect ", so that" instead of "such that" -- CNS

[OK] l.172 "information" is uncountable -- please rephrase.
[two pieces of information]

[OK] l.179 Is "clusters of a track" a good term?
['track' reference removed since not useful]

[OK] l.185 "close-by", without a hyphen it is an adverb -- CNS

[OK, Chuck Norris approved] l.217 "is minimal" looks more correct for me -- CNS

[OK] l.219 "may happen"

[TO SEE] l.224 Let me a joke, is this line a machine code?
[Don't know what to replace with. Any suggestions ?]

[OK] l.237 "surround the shower" or what?

[OK] l.255 "all hit positions" -- CNS

Figure 8 What a nice octopus!
[From Méditerrannée !]

[OK] l.261 "with a momentum equal to that of beams"

[OK] l.262 Once again, "The inputs are loaded" is slightly obscure to me, please say a few words about those inputs.

[OK] l.278 "These points  are extracted for each energy value, using..." Do you mean "first, a gaussian .." or "the first gaussian"?  Please check -- something is wrong with this and the next sentences.
[Simply rephrased ...]

[OK] l.281 "From the latter"

[OK] l.295 "... showers,  two events ..."

[OK] l.298 The sentence seems to look better without "also".

[TO SEE] Figure 11 looks poor and uninformative -- not good for the JINST.
[Any suggestions ?]

[OK] l.310 "same" is probably used incorrectly here -- CNS
[in the same one -> in a new one]

[TODO] l.317-318 No, we can hardly see, please rephrase.

[OK] Caption of fig.12 "Colours correspond"

[OK] l.327 It is better to replace "of" by "at".

[OK] l.330 Why "We CAN check ..."? Have you checked that?
['We can check that' -> 'We can also see that'. Yes it has been checked]

[TODO] Figures 14 and 15 should be probably enlarged since letters of legends are too small and nearly unreadable when  printed to paper if we care about the paper reading.

[TO SEE] The definition of efficiency and purity is too simple since it does take into account the threshold of a hit, so we don't know which hits were incorrectly assigned by the algorithm. Can we -- perhaps in the future -- weight the hits with their energy? I remember you have tagged them.
[I don't understand your remark, sorry. Can you rephrase it or add more comments]

[OK] l.341 "As" seems ambiguous here, I would write "In the same way as". -- CNS

[OK] l.358 typo "at least one"

[OK] l.359 see l.341

l.361 I absolutely do not understand how "This means", whereas I perfectly understand your thought concerning the binary-like behavior. Maybe this is my problem, but would you add some explanation to the text.

l.369 "show"

As I wrote before, we shall be proud of the right assignment of ENERGY, not just hits.

l.379  Move "pointing TO the particle entry point" to immediately after "..., a track".

l.380 see 369

l.385 typo "and shows that"

And again -- see l.361 -- I have stumbled over "At small separation distance (5cm), the difference stays constant and shows ..." Please rephrase what you mean.

l.386 "or merging with the charged hadron"

l.390 "improve" is certainly not sufficient: "to provide/facilitate the PFA performance".
