Oh, Remi, everything is good for a CAN. Thanks.

# Correction Daniel Jeans 2 :

Dear Remi,

Thanks for the updated note, and sorry for the long time it's taken me to reply.

I'm happy for the note to be published as a CAN.

I noticed just one spelling mistake (during a quick reading-through):
[OK] l175: "th" -> "the"

Regards,
Daniel.

# Correction  Vladislav Balgura 2 :

As promised, further comments from my side...

[NOT] l 167 - 170 - This part logically belongs to discussion in 5) == l.158 - 162  (Fig. 6 right is explained before comparing it to Fig. 6 left)
[It is not related to the overlay analysis itself but to the inputs provided to the reconstruction algorithm. That's why we put it here]

[OK] l. 175 th -> the

[OK] Fig.10 caption:
"The mean difference between the reconstructed energy and the measured energy before
reconstruction for which at least one neutral hadron has been reconstructed."
-> "The mean difference between the reconstructed energy and the measured energy before
reconstruction *in events with at least one reconstructed neutral hadron*".

[OK] l 206 -> "In the same way as for the purity, the mean reconstructed neutral energy increases with the charged particle energy."
Not clear. In addition, the (neutral particle) purity *decreases* with the charged particle energy (Fig 9 right)?

[OK] l. 212 The ArborPFA, based on the tree-like structure of hadronic showers has been described in details
-> In fact, it is described in Appendix, so it is not yet described at this point (unless one reads Appendix before the main text, of course).
["in details" removed since a short description is still provided]

[OK] l213 using data taken SPS H2 -> using data taken *at* SPS H2

[OK] l 228 show -> shows

[NOT] l 230 At small separation distance (5cm), the difference stays constant
-> not clear. Stays constant when varying what? At fixed distance (5 cm), one may vary only energy? but, in fact, there is a dependence on energy on Fig. 10?
May be "Above 5 cm distance, the difference stays constant"??
[The difference does not vary with the distance but with the energy]

[OK] Concerning references: please, check them and ensure that they appear in an ascending order in the text: on page 2 they go like 2, 5, 1, ... instead of 1,2,3...

I am sorry, I have not read the Appendix and your answers, and may be miss something. Will do it tomorrow.
Anyway, as I said to Marina, the note is much more "readable" now, which is very advantageous given the amount of work invested to ArborPFA and the high quality of the obtained results.
I am clearly in favor of CALICE-wide circulation.

Best regards,
Vladik.
